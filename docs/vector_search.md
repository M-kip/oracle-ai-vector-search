# Oracle AI Vector Search

One of the biggest benefits of Oracle AI Vector Search is that **semantic search on unstructured data** can be combined with **relational search on business data**. This eliminates ata fragmentation between multiple systems.

Oracle AI Vector Search also supports **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a breakthrough generative AI technique that combines large language models (LLMs) and private business data. RAG provides higher accuracy and avoids having to expose private data by including it in the large language model training data.

## Vector Data Type

**Vector Data Type** was introduced in Oracle Database 23ai. 

Vector Data Type allows you to store vector embeddings alongside other business data. In other words, it allows you to apply semantic queries on business data.

## Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings are **mathematical representations of data points**. They assign mathematical representations based on meaning and context of unstructured data.

Vector embeddings can be used to **represent almost any type of data**, including text, audio, or visual such as pictures. And they are used in **proximity searches**.

In order to get vector embeddings, you can either use ONNX embedding machine learning models or access third-party REST APIs.

## Similarity Search

Vector data is usually unevenly distributed and clustered into groups that are semantically related. Doing a similarity search based on a given query vector is equivalent to retrieving the **k nearest vectors** to your query vector in your vector space. **It is important to find the relative order of distances rather than the actual distance.**

Similarity searches tend to get data from one or more clusters, depending on the value of the query vector and the fetch size. Searches can be approximate or specific.

*Example. The distance between dog and wolf in the vector space is shorter than the distance between dog and kitten. So in this space, a dog is more similar to a wolf than it is to a kitten.*

## Vector Embeddings Models

Vector Embedding Models allow you to **assign meaning** to a word, or a sentence, or the pixels in an image, or perhaps audio. They allows you to **quantify features or dimensions**.

Most modern vector embeddings use a **transformer model**. Depending on the type of your data, you can use different pre-trained open source models to create vector embeddings. Each model determines **the number of dimensions for your vectors**.

For example:
- Sentence Transformers for textual data
- Residual Network (ResNet) for visual data
- Visual Spectrogram Representation for audio data

## Import Embedding Models

Two approaches to generate vector embeddings:
- Outside the Oracle DB
- Within the Oracle DB (ONNX)

In order to use pre-trained open source embeddings models (or your own embedding models) within the Oracle DB, you need to use models that are compatible with the **Open Neural Network Exchange Standard (ONNX)**, also known as Onyx.

Oracle Database implements an Onyx runtime directly within the database, and this is going to allow you to generate vector embeddings directly inside the Oracle Database using SQL.
