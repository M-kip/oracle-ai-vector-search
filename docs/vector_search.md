# Oracle AI Vector Search

One of the biggest benefits of Oracle AI Vector Search is that **semantic search on unstructured data** can be combined with **relational search on business data**. This eliminates ata fragmentation between multiple systems.

Oracle AI Vector Search also supports **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a breakthrough generative AI technique that combines large language models (LLMs) and private business data. RAG provides higher accuracy and avoids having to expose private data by including it in the large language model training data.
